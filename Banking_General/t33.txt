With the introduction of Core Banking Solution (CBS), it is expected that customers of banks would be treated uniformly at any sales or service delivery point. It is, however, observed that some banks are discriminating against their own customers on the basis of one branch being designated as the 'home' or 'base' branch where charges are not levied for products / services and other branches of the same bank being referred to as 'non-home' branches where charges are levied for the same products / services. The charges generally referred to as 'Intersol' charges, are also not uniform across home / non-home branches. This practice followed by some banks is contrary to the spirit of the Reserve Bank's guidelines on reasonableness of bank charges. As 'Intersol' charges are charges levied by the bank to cover the cost of extending services to customers by using the CBS / Internet / Intranet platform, the cost should be branch / customer agnostic in-principle. It is clarified that cash handling charges may not be included under intersol charges.

Banks are advised to follow a uniform, fair and transparent pricing policy and not discriminate between their customers at home branch and non-home branches. Accordingly, if a particular service is provided free at home branch, the same should be available free at non home branches also. There should be no discrimination as regards intersol charges between similar transactions done by customers at home branch and those done at non-home branches.
