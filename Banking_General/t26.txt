 Keeping in view the importance of credit discipline for reduction in NPA level of banks, banks should, at the time of opening current accounts, insist on a declaration to the effect that the account holder is not enjoying any credit facility with any other bank. Banks should scrupulously ensure that their branches do not open current accounts of entities which enjoy credit facilities (fund based or non-fund based) from the banking system without specifically obtaining a No-Objection Certificate from the lending bank(s). Banks should note that non-adherence to the above discipline could be perceived to be abetting the siphoning of funds and such violations which are either reported to RBI or noticed during our inspection would make the concerned banks liable for penalty under Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

(ii) Banks may open current accounts of prospective customers in case no response is received from the existing bankers after a minimum waiting period of a fortnight.  If a response is received within a fortnight, banks should assess the situation with reference to information provided on the prospective customer by the bank concerned and are not required to solicit a formal no objection, consistent with true freedom to the customer of banks as well as needed due diligence on the customer by the bank.

(iii) In case of a prospective customer who is a corporate or large borrower enjoying credit facilities from more than one bank, the banks should exercise due diligence and inform the consortium leader, if under consortium, and the concerned banks, if under multiple banking arrangement.
