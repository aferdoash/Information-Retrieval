The process flow followed for ATM transactions varies from bank to bank. The type of card readers installed by each ATM vendor also contributes to the variation in the process flow. Security concerns arise in the case of certain type of card readers which facilitate multiple transactions without the need for pin validation for every successive transaction. The possibility of frauds / misuse of cards is very high in a scenario where the card is inserted in such reader slots, the card holder fails to collect the card after the transaction is completed and the card is misused. This risk can be eliminated to a great extent if, for every transaction, the process flow demands pin validation. Hence each bank may ensure that the process flow is modified to provide for the pin validation for every transaction, including balance enquiry facilitated through ATM. Further, as an additional safety measure, banks are advised that the time-out of sessions should be enabled for all screens / stages of ATM transaction keeping in view the time required for such functions in normal course.

Non-adherence to the above provisions shall attract penalty as prescribed under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).
