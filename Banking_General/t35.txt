No particular banking hours have been prescribed by law and a bank may fix, after due notice to its customers, whatever business hours are convenient to it i.e., to work in double shifts, to observe weekly holiday on a day other than Sunday or to function on Sundays in addition to the normal working days, subject to observing normal working hours for public transactions referred to in paragraph above.

In order to safeguard banks' own interest, a bank closing any of its offices on a day other than a public holiday, will have to give due and sufficient notice to all the parties concerned who are or are likely to be affected by such closure. Thus, in all the above cases, it is necessary for a bank to give sufficient notice to the public/its customers of its intention. What is sufficient or due notice is a question of fact, depending on the circumstances of each case. It is also necessary to avoid any infringement of any other relevant local laws such as Shops and Establishment Act, etc.

Further, the provisions, if any, in regard to the banks' obligations, to the staff under the Industrial Awards / Settlements, should be complied with. Clearing House authority of the place should also be consulted in this regard.

The banks' branches in rural areas can fix the business hours (i.e. number of hours, as well as timings) and the weekly holidays to suit local requirements. This may, however, be done subject to the guidelines given above.
