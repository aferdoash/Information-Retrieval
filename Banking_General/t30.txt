Banks were mandated to send online alerts to the cardholders for all Card Not Present (CNP) transactions for the value of ` 5000/- and above. Recently, incidents of unauthorized / fraudulent withdrawals at ATMs have come to the notice of RBI.  It is, therefore, decided that banks may take steps to put in place a system of online alerts for all types of transactions irrespective of the amount, involving usage of cards at various channels. This measure is expected to encourage further usage of cards at various delivery channels. Banks have been advised to implement this measure latest by June 30, 2011. Banks should provide easier methods (like SMS) for the customer to block his card and get a confirmation to that effect after blocking the card.
