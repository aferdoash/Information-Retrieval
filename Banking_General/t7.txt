There may be occasions when Clearing House operations may have to be temporarily suspended for reasons beyond the control of the authorities concerned. Such suspension entails hardship to the constituents of the banks because of their inability to realize promptly the proceeds of cheques, drafts, etc., drawn on the local banks other than those with whom they maintain accounts. Some remedial action has to be taken during such contingencies to minimise, as far as possible, the inconvenience and hardship to banks' constituents as also to maintain good customer service. Thus, whenever clearing is suspended and it is apprehended that the suspension may be prolonged, banks may temporarily accommodate their constituents, both borrowers and depositors, to the extent possible by purchasing the local cheques, drafts, etc., deposited in their accounts for collection, special consideration being shown in respect of cheques drawn by Government departments/companies of good standing and repute, as also demand drafts drawn on local banks. While extending this facility, banks would no doubt take into consideration such factors as creditworthiness, integrity, past dealings and occupation of the constituents, so as to guard themselves against any possibility of such instruments being dishonoured subsequently.
