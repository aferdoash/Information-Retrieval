Banks have been mandated to necessarily put in place additional factor of authentication/validation based on information not visible on the cards for all on-line  Card not Present (CNP) transactions in a phased manner, starting with online transactions followed by Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Mail Order Telephone Order(MOTO) and Standing Instructions (SI). In the case of MOTO and SI transactions, it has been stated that in case of customer complaint regarding issues, if any, arising out of transactions effected without the additional factor of authentication after the stipulated date, the issuer bank has to reimburse the loss to the customer further without demur.
