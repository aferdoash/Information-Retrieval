Banks should give constant attention to ensure entry of correct and legible particulars in the pass books and statement of accounts.

(ii) The banks often show the entries in depositors' passbooks / statements of accounts, as "by clearing" or "by cheque". Further, it is observed that in the case of Electronic Clearing System (ECS) and RBI Electronic Fund Transfer (RBIEFT), banks generally do not provide any details even though brief particulars of the remittance are provided by the receiving bank. In some cases, computerized entries use codes which just cannot be deciphered. With a view to avoiding inconvenience to depositors, banks should avoid such inscrutable entries in passbooks / statement of accounts and ensure that brief, intelligible particulars are invariably entered in passbooks / statement of account.
