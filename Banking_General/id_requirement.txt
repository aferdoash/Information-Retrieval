Corporate and other business customers For corporate and other business customers, banks should obtain evidence of their legal status, such as an incorporation document, partnership agreement, association documents or a business licence. For large corporate accounts, a financial  statement of the business or a description of the customerâ€™s principal line of business should also be obtained. In addition, if significant changes to the company structure or ownership occur subsequently, further checks should be made. In all cases, banks need to verify that the corporation or business entity exists and engages in its  stated business. The original documents or certified copies of certificates should be produced for verification.
Personal customers For personal customers, banks need to obtain the following information: 1. Name and/or names used; 2. Permanent residential address; 3. Date and place of birth; 4. Name of employer or nature of self employment/business; 5. Specimen signature; and 6. Source of funds. Additional information would relate to nationality or country of origin, public or high profile position, etc. Banks should verify the information against original  documents of identity issued by an official authority (examples including identity cards and passports). Such documents should be those that are most difficult to obtain illicitly. In countries where new customers do not possess the prime identity documents, e.g., identity cards, passport or driving licenses, some flexibility may be required. However, particular care should  be taken in accepting documents that are easily forged or which can be easily obtained in false identities. Where there is face to face contact, the appearance should be verified against an official document bearing a photograph. Any subsequent changes to the above information should also be recorded and verified.
